# How Data & AI can help detect Methane emissions
**Centrale - Essec Tech Challenge with Quantum Black, AI by McKinsey**
*4 days hackathon.*

The dataset consists of 430 satellite images from SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research available at https://earth.sron.nl/methane-emissions/ . The images were of size 64x64 in greyscale. 
The goal of the hackathon was to dentify whether each location contains a methane plume or not. We also developped use cases where this model can be used to drive positive impact.
